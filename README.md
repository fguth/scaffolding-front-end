# front end scaffolding

Starting a new static project?
Save time using this marvelous scaffolding!

After cloning this repository, run `make install` to grab all dependencies.

Then run the following commands, each in a seperate terminal:


```shell
# watch over file changes
make watch
```


```shell
# start a web server
make run


# you may pass a different port than the 3000 default
make run PORT=8080
```
